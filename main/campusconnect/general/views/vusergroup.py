# Need mechanism to test if groups we need exist and if not automatically create them.
# To facilitate avoiding having to do this manually each time and possibly screw it up when doing it manually.
# creating of groups.
# assignment of permissions to each group.
#
# ensure this automatically propogates to new views/etc as they are added. Hoping someone adds this later as
# new stuff is created is problematic

# Create a set of defauilt users for testing who belong to the various groups.
#
# May need to extend this to auto populate other kinds of data such as default
# product lines, etc.
# If so this would be a view available only to an admin user that is ideally run/done/viewed
# Once for a new database but if done again is properly handled and not done twice.

# Admin form to promote users to other groups.
# when promoting user log date, time, and admin user id doing the promotion

# view to list all grlup members

# Probably enfrcing access to views with permission decorators
# Because we have a mix of regular django views and class based views we will
# need a regular permission and a permissionrequiredMixin.
#
# OR INSTEAD USE user_passes_test decorator which is similar to permission decorator
# but allows more flexibility.

# Probably need a organizational way to organize views by their required permissions.
# Hunting through various views files setting it on and off per view in location is
# problmatic. confusing and error prone.

# Probably need an organizational way to control the url parameters for permission decorators
# redirecting users if they fail to have the proper permissions.

# WRINKLES TO HANDLE/USE

# Django.user.object    active boolean    enable/disable this instead of deleting accounts
#     test how this flag affects all other permissions validation.
#     i assume when disabled everything else will fail but not sure until test
#
# Django.user.object staff status
#     Designates whether the user can log into this admin site.
#     IS THIS ENOUGH TO SPECIFY SOMEONE AS IN THE ADMIN GROUP ABOVE.
#     IT MIGHT BE.
#   THIS ISN'T QUITE ENOUGH, YOU CAN HAVE THIS BOOLEAN SET TO TRUE AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE ADMIN BUT
#   NOT HAVE ANY PERMISSIONS TO VIEW ANY OF THE MODELS AND CHANGE THEM.
#   looks like if you're using this to give user admin access you have to set this boolean
#    and
#   set the permissions they have (or group they belong to with those permissions)
#
# Django.user.object Superuser status
#     Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.
#     Dangerous and special permissions. NOt to be handed out lightly. Don't rely on this.


# Register django app.model classes specifying their permissions,etc.
# HERE'S WHERE THEY COULD BE PROGRAMICALLY ADDED TO THE ADMIN SYSTEM.
# HERE'S WHERE THEIR ATUAL NAMES AND DISPLAY NAMES COULD BE ORGANIZED
#
# Method to iterate through all model classes in django system.
# Compare these to ones registered to specific group permissions.
# Display ones that fall through. I.e. Might be new and not added to registration system.


# programmable method to find all view urls and then permissions for each.














# code tidbits:


# # add user to group
# from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
# group = Group.objects.get(name='groupname')
# user.groups.add(group)
