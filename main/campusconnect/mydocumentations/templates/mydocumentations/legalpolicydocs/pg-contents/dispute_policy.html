<p>Please read carefully the terms and conditions of our Dispute and Refund Policy. Since we use the third-party transaction service
    'PayPal' as our payment gateway, when you request for a refund, the request is directed to PayPal for processing the transaction. 
    PayPal takes 7 to 10 business days to receive any request and thereby, that time will be taken to process the refund. If you contact us
     before PayPal's response period of 10 days aforementioned, we might not be able to provide you with any proper reply on the refund
      status. Once PayPal has made the transaction and confirmed with us, we will let you know promptly via email.</p>
