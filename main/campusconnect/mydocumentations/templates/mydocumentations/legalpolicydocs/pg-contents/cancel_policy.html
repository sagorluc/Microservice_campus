<p class="text-reset">Please read carefully the terms and conditions of our Cancellation and Refund Policy.</p><br>
<ul class="text-reset">
    <li>You can cancel an order only if you purchase item(s) as a registered customer.</li><br>
    <li>Every order has a grace period after purchase. You cannot cancel an order after the grace period is over because once the grace period is over, we start processing your order.</li><br>
    <li>If you want to cancel an order, you need to log into your CampusLinker account Dashboard, and need to go to 'My Orders', and then cancel from there.</li><br>
    <li>We will send you a confirmation email after you request a cancellation.</li><br>
    <li>Since we use the third-party transaction service 'aamarPay' as our payment gateway, when you request a refund, the request is directed to aamarPay for processing the transaction. aamarPay takes them 7 to 10 business days to receive any request and thereby that time will be taken to process the refund.</li><br>
    <li>If you contact us before aamarPay's response period of 10 days aforementioned, we might not be able to provide you with any proper reply on the refund status. Once aamarPay has made the transaction and confirmed with us, we will let you know promptly via email.</li>
</ul><br>
<p class="text-reset">We will check your claim and grant/deny refund requests based on your particular case.</p>
