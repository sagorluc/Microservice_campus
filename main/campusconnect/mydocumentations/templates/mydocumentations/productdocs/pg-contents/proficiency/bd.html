    Background
    </h3>
</p>
<p>

    Job search process for a non-immigrant is way more challenging than that of a USA Citizen for some particular
    reasons, such as limited Visa sponsorship opportunity from a company,
    Legal restrictions on standard weekly work hour under CPT visa, super strict rules and regulations for an H1B visa dependent, and so on.

    Key features
    </h3>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Bandwidth helps identify the loopholes in a resume
    that could be critical when it is being reviewed 
    by a Hiring Manager
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
    Bandwidth helps identify the skillgaps of an applicant
    that could cost him/her to be selected for the next round 
    in the job search process
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
    Bandwidth helps personalized solutions to different visa category based job search candidates. 

    For example, the resume of a candidate with OPT visa 
    is not being reviewed by the identical way to a resume 
    of a candidate with H1B visa.

    Bandwidth offers personalized services that offer solutions
    to the challenges imposed by different visa categories such as
    CPT, OPT, H1B, GC EAD.
