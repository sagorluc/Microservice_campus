<ul>
    <li>
    Adhoc service is a two fold workflow. 
    First, you (a customer) will submit a service request form, and 
    you need to wait until our customer support response to your
    request.
    
    Once you receive a reponse from us, you either may need to 
    purchase a service, or act accordingly as instructed in the email.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
    Based on our current workload, the initial reponse time for an Adhoc service request is
    usually 6 (Six) hours. Becasuse we work 24x7, not only in regular business hour
    like 9 to 5.

            It is quite possible that a customer may overlook the service he or she 
            needs offered by Exp180 services. For many reasons, they may fail to 
            choose the suitable service from Exp180 service list.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
            Our dedicated Adhoc request customer service team will review the request,
            and will respond to the request accordingly. Within the response,
            our customer support team may send a direct Exp180 service which will
            suffice the customer's need, or they will create a particular service 
            and will send the link to purchase the service to the customer.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
        When a job search candidate runs out of options from the 
        Exp180 service list, he or she needs to submit an Adhoc service request.
